## MongoDB Authentication
This project uses MongoDB for storing election-related data such as voter and candidate information. The MongoDB database is authenticated using the connection string provided in the class declarations.
Database Connection: The MongoDB connection is configured using a MongoDB Atlas cloud instance. The connection string contains authentication credentials (username and password) to securely access the database.

## How Authentication Works:
When the admin logs in, their credentials are verified against MongoDB's user records, additionally , libraries were used to enforce the password by hashing it with the SHA-256 algorithm.
MongoDB Atlas handles authentication and connection security, ensuring that only authorized users can access the database.
